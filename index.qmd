Currently, I am the Chief Technology Officer at [Arcascope](https://www.arcascope.com). Arcascope provides algorithmic solutions for tracking, predicting and correcting human circadian rhythms. Our technology allows for personalized predictions to be formulated efficiently and accurately using commericial wearable devices. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in joining our team at Arcascope or if you would like to partner with us.

I'm an experienced data scientist, mathematician, technical leader and just general problem solver. My years in academia provided me with a depth of expertise in applied mathematics and scientific computing and a base of knowledge which enables me to quickly get up to speed in new fields. My years of teaching the fundamentals of data science and statistics helped me develop as a technical communicator and become "brilliant in the basics", as we say in the Marine Corps. 

Speaking of which, my years as an active-duty Marine Officer and subsequent service as a reservist have trained me in leadership, organization and planning. More recently, they have also challenged me technically as I moved into the cyberspace field. My experience at Arcascope has challenged me to grow in all these areas. I have learned the fundamental skills of moving code and models into production both hands-on and from a leadership prospective. This has taught me data science pipelining/ ML Ops, AWS cloud architecture, iOS mobile development, DevOps and leading an Agile/SCRUM team of developers. Helping grow Arcascope has been the most satisfying experience of my professional career.
