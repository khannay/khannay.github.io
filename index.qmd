I'm an experienced data scientist, mathematician, technical leader and just general problem solver. My years in academia provided me with a depth of expertise in applied mathematics and scientific computing and a base of knowledge which enables me to quickly get up to speed in new fields. My years of teaching the fundamentals of data science and statistics helped me develop as a technical communicator and become "brilliant in the basics", as we say in the Marine Corps. 

Speaking of which, my years as an active-duty Marine Officer and subsequent service as a reservist have trained me in leadership, organization and planning. More recently, they have also challenged me technically as I moved into the cyberspace field. My experience at Arcascope has challenged me to grow in all these areas. I have learned the fundamental skills of moving code and models into production both hands-on and from a leadership prospective. This has taught me data science pipelining/ ML Ops, AWS cloud architecture, iOS mobile development, DevOps and leading an Agile/SCRUM team of developers.
