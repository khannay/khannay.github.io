    "text": "Currently, I am the Chief Technology Officer at Arcascope. Arcascope provides algorithmic solutions for tracking, predicting and correcting human circadian rhythms. Our technology allows for personalized predictions to be formulated efficiently and accurately using commericial wearable devices. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in joining our team at Arcascope or if you would like to partner with us.\nI’m an experienced data scientist, mathematician, technical leader and just general problem solver. My years in academia provided me with a depth of expertise in applied mathematics and scientific computing and a base of knowledge which enables me to quickly get up to speed in new fields. My years of teaching the fundamentals of data science and statistics helped me develop as a technical communicator and become “brilliant in the basics”, as we say in the Marine Corps.\nSpeaking of which, my years as an active-duty Marine Officer and subsequent service as a reservist have trained me in leadership, organization and planning. More recently, they have also challenged me technically as I moved into the cyberspace field. My experience at Arcascope has challenged me to grow in all these areas. I have learned the fundamental skills of moving code and models into production both hands-on and from a leadership prospective. This has taught me data science pipelining/ ML Ops, AWS cloud architecture, iOS mobile development, DevOps and leading an Agile/SCRUM team of developers. Helping grow Arcascope has been the most satisfying experience of my professional career."

    "text": "Research Interests\n\nMachine Learning\nData Science\nCircadian rhythms and sleep\nBlending physiological mathematical models with deep learning\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan\nPhD in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics Advisors: Victoria Booth and Danny Forger\n\n\nAnn Arbor, MI Granted May 2017\n\n\n\nDissertation: Macroscopic Models and Phase Resetting of Coupled Biological Oscillators\nWinner of 2017 Smereka Prize for best dissertation in the department\n\n\n\nUniversity of Texas\nB.S.(Honors) in Mathematics B.S.(Honors) in Biology\n\n\nAustin, TX Granted May 2009\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\n\nArcascope\n\n\nSeptember 2020 - present\n\n\nChief Technology Officer\n\nCofounder and CTO for a mobile health start-up spun out of my academic research. I officially joined the company when awarded a SBIR grant ($1.6 million) funding the development of an iOS app providing light timing recommendations to treat chronic fatigue in chemotherapy patients.\nIn my first three months I created and implemented the core algorithms used by the company to predict the users internal circadian phase based on wearable data streams. I created a novel method machine learning technique used for the extraction of weak periodic signals from non-stationary time series to extract estimates from heart rate time-series collected by common wearable devices. I also created the models used to predict uncertainty, combine predictions between approaches and handle chronic missing data. This work formed the basis for the companies core intellectual property and the first patent submitted.\nThe next six months focused on scaling and moving these algorithms into production to support the clinical trial. I oversaw the companies first developer hires and stepped into a technical management role as we developed the cloud architecture for the clinical trial app based on a microservices design paradigm. I supervised the development of the iOS app and took an active and supervisory role in the back-end development. The clinical trial app was finished three months ahead of schedule and has run for over 100 participants over the last year without any significant outages or bugs while requiring minimal maintenance.\nThe next three months were focused on customer discovery and algorithm development to support a pivot towards a beachhead market of shift workers. This is a much more challenging technical problem and required the development of a new algorithm for lighting recommendations which accounts for user’s constraints. I then acted as a primary developer and project manager for the development of our second iOS app which was moved from first line of code to MVP in three months- more than doubling the development velocity of the first app with the same team.\nIn the next nine months I was heavily involved in pitching investors (30+ times) the shift worker app and ensuring the technology was respondent to the demand signal generated from defense ,healthcare, airline and lighting verticals. In September 2022, Arcascope closed an oversubscribed seed-round of 2.7 million to bring the shift worker app to market. The app was soft launched in the app store in September 2022 and we are currently cultivating B2B partners in the health care sector.\nDuring this time I also developed core machine learning algorithms for the classification of shift work schedules from users wearable data, sleep classification using wearable data streams and hybrid models for blending deep-learning with physiological constraints. I have also helped build the full-stack machine learning pipeline from ETL through model training, and deployment using the AWS stack.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan \n\n\nSeptember 2020 - June 2021\n\n\nVisiting Assistant Professor\n\nConducted research on circadian rhythms and sleep under the supervision of Dr. Danny Forger\nDeveloped mathematical models of SNS Pain under the supervision of Dr. Victoria Booth\n\n\n\nSchreiner University\n\n\nAugust 2017 - August 2020\n\n\nAssistant Professor of Mathematics\n\nReceived the 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Young Investigator award for research for research on low-dimensional representations of oscillating systems.\nCo-Principal Investigator on National Science Foundation Grant ($500k) to study mathematical models for circadian and sleep jointly with collaborators at the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Michigan.\nConducted research on blending domain knowledge codified by traditional applied mathematics models and artificial neural networks. Developed a simulation platform for human circadian rhythms and statistical models for the prediction of circadian dynamics using wearable data streams.\nTaught mathematics and introductory statistics/data science courses to undergraduate students. Advised the administration on the enrollment and faculty load calculations and data collection pipelines for student retention/churn.\nAuthored open source textbook on data science and introductory statistics for undergraduate students.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\n\nSeptember 2013 - June 2017\n\n\nGraduate student\n\nDoctoral studies in Applied Mathematics, research in coupled oscillator networks, phase response curves and circadian rhythms.\nCompleted coursework in applied mathematics, mathematical biology, numerical analysis and high performance computing.\nReceived the Smereka award for the best doctoral thesis in applied mathematics in 2017\nReceived the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Life Sciences young investigator award in 2020."
